In this scenario, the system is specifically tailored to address risks related to the exposure of data in a job role, which in this case is financial data from accountants. It operates with specialised dataset containing around 200 entries and 5000 entries for the generic dataset. Despite the relatively small size of the specialised dataset, they are of high quality. They are crafted to simulate real-world scenarios by impersonating various entities that accountants commonly interact with, including suppliers, banks, customers, investors, potential investors, and tax authorities. Moreover, they incorporate social engineering tactics from phishing attacks to enhance their effectiveness.
Having a two datasets allows one being the generic dataset, act as default dataset relvent to all roles whilst, those with high data exposure will have unique and specialised datasets for extra precaution.
