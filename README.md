# Updated-Project-Spear

This is an update to the Orignal Project Spear. It includes true machine learning and role based datasets to increase effectivness in detection.

The system is specifically tailored to address risks related to the exposure of data in a job role by minimising the success of phishing campaigns that target those high exposure individuals.In this scenario it relates to financial data from accountants. 
 

The idea is to layer a role centric dataset and a generic dataset for maximum diligence. The role centric dataset contains around 200 entries and the general dataset contains 5000 entries. Despite the relatively small size of the specialised dataset, they are of high quality. They are crafted to simulate real-world contexts by impersonating various entities that accountants commonly interact with such as suppliers, banks, customers, investors, investors, and tax authorities. Moreover, they incorporate convincing social engineering tactics within the pretexting to help the 
machine learning algorithm pickup phishing just from those nuances.

The last is flagged email aggregation. If any of the programs detect a phishing email, the email itself gets sent to an external file with metadata of the email and its recipient. This is important as it allows manual analysis of the email which could then be used for staff training or added to the dataset to increase the strength of the machine learning pool.
